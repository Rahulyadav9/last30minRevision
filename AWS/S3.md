Here’s a **30-minute AWS S3 interview Q&A set** — covering **core concepts, architecture, permissions, versioning, and read/write operations** — ideal for an **experienced developer (7+ years)** 👇

---

## 🧠 **1. What is Amazon S3?**

**Answer:**
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data anytime.
It stores data as **objects in buckets** and is **highly durable (99.999999999%)** and scalable.

---

## 🪣 **2. What is the structure of an S3 object?**

Each object has:

* **Key** – unique name
* **Value** – actual data
* **Metadata** – data about data
* **Version ID** (if versioning enabled)

---

## ⚙️ **3. How does S3 differ from EBS and EFS?**

| Feature  | S3                   | EBS             | EFS                     |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Type     | Object Storage       | Block Storage   | File Storage            |
| Access   | HTTP(S) via API      | Attached to EC2 | Shared across instances |
| Use Case | Backup, static files | Databases, OS   | Shared data for apps    |

---

## 🔒 **4. How to control access to an S3 bucket?**

You can control access using:

* **Bucket policies**
* **IAM policies**
* **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**
* **S3 Access Points**
* **Block Public Access**

**Example Bucket Policy:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
  }]
}
```

---

## 📜 **5. What is S3 versioning and why use it?**

Versioning keeps **multiple versions of an object** to protect against accidental deletion or overwriting.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket my-bucket \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

---

## 🌍 **6. Explain S3 storage classes.**

* **S3 Standard** – frequent access
* **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** – auto moves data to cheaper tiers
* **S3 Standard-IA** – infrequent access
* **S3 Glacier / Deep Archive** – long-term archival
* **S3 One Zone-IA** – single AZ infrequent storage

---

## 🔁 **7. What is S3 Lifecycle Management?**

Automatically moves data between storage classes or deletes old versions.

**Example Rule:**

```json
{
  "Rules": [{
    "ID": "MoveToGlacier",
    "Prefix": "",
    "Status": "Enabled",
    "Transitions": [{
      "Days": 30,
      "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
    }]
  }]
}
```

---

## 🌐 **8. What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?**

It speeds up uploads using **CloudFront’s edge network**.
✅ Useful for large file uploads from different regions.

---

## 🧩 **9. What is S3 Event Notification?**

You can trigger:

* **Lambda**
* **SQS**
* **SNS**

When events like `s3:ObjectCreated` or `s3:ObjectRemoved` occur.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "LambdaFunctionConfigurations": [{
    "Events": ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"],
    "LambdaFunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:region:acct:function:processFile"
  }]
}
```

---

## 🧮 **10. Read/Write Operations using AWS SDK**

### 📝 Upload (Write)

**Node.js Example:**

```js
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

const params = {
  Bucket: "my-bucket",
  Key: "images/photo.png",
  Body: fs.createReadStream("./photo.png"),
  ContentType: "image/png"
};

s3.upload(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  else console.log("File uploaded:", data.Location);
});
```

---

### 📖 Read (Download)

```js
const params = {
  Bucket: "my-bucket",
  Key: "images/photo.png"
};

s3.getObject(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  else fs.writeFileSync("downloaded.png", data.Body);
});
```

---

## 📦 **11. How do you make an S3 bucket public?**

1. Turn off **Block Public Access**
2. Add **Bucket Policy** allowing `s3:GetObject` for `"Principal": "*"`

---

## 🧰 **12. What is S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)?**

Automatically replicates objects to a bucket in another AWS region for:

* Disaster recovery
* Latency reduction

---

## ⚡ **13. How can you optimize performance for large uploads?**

* Use **Multipart Uploads** for >100MB files
* Enable **Transfer Acceleration**
* Use **S3 Byte-Range Fetches**

---

## 🧱 **14. How do S3 Consistency Models work?**

* **Read-after-write consistency** for new objects
* **Eventual consistency** for overwrite/delete operations (now mostly strong consistency)

---

## 🧾 **15. Real-time Interview Scenario:**

> Your app stores user uploads in S3. A Lambda should resize images once uploaded. How would you implement?

✅ **Answer:**

* Create S3 bucket
* Enable `s3:ObjectCreated` event
* Trigger a **Lambda function**
* Lambda reads the image, processes it, uploads resized image to another bucket

---

Would you like me to also include **comparison of S3 with SQL/NoSQL databases** (since both store data differently)? It’s a common follow-up in senior-level interviews.
